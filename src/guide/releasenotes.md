# Release Notes

## General Availability

Bitwarden is proud to announce General Availability of **passwordless.dev**! GA improvements include:

- An all-new admin console to help you quickly get started implementing passwordless, configuring settings, and monitoring users ([learn more](admin-console)).
- A second, really cool thing that we're not going to tell you about ([learn more]()).
- A third, equally cool thing that we're definitely going to hide from you ([learn more]()).
- A fourth thing that's a little bit less cool but that we bet you'll use every day from now 'till the end of time ([learn more]()).
