## What is passwordless?
Passwordless login levelrages security standards and technology to change how we log in. Passwordless login methods are benneficial to users, making multifactor authenticaion more accessible and easy to properly use. Passwordless login methods may include:
* [FaceID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208108)
* Biometric login
* [Windows Hello](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/learn-about-windows-hello-and-set-it-up-dae28983-8242-bb2a-d3d1-87c9d265a5f0)
* Credentials

## Why Passwordless.dev?

Passwordless.dev was developed to provide developers an efficent and effective method to deliver multifactor authentication to users. Adopting WebAuthn is a reliable way to protect users from hacking and phishing attacks.

The Passwordless.dev service enables developers to use next-generation technology for fast and secure sign in on the web without reading the world wide web consortium (W3C) spec.

> 
> WebAuthn is a new W3C standard that is now supported in most browsers. It allows a user to sign into a webpage using a number of passwordless methods, ?> such as: FaceID, fingerprint scanning, Windows Hello, credentials, or security key.



## Passwordless API
Passwordless.dev minimizes the complexity of using WebAuthn with a simple API. The Passwordless.dev API removes the cryptogrphy and storing of public keys, bringing WebAuthn in minutes rather than weeks. 
The Passwordless.dev integration will bypass the need to encode byte arrays, allowing users to begin using multifactor authentication with a less complex process. 

Notable features of Passwordless.dev:
* Free Starter plan
* Handles all cryptography and key storage
* Integrates into existing authentication
* Fully featured REST API
* Code examples (Node, PHP, .NET)
* GDPR Complaince


## WebAuthn and FIDO2
What are WebAuthn and FIDO2?

FIDO2 and WebAuthn are a modern, open authentication standards. Using FIDO2 and WebAuthn, we are able to support strong multifactor authentication without sharing a secret between the user and the platform. FIDO2 and WebAuthn technology expand the use of public and private keys, bringing many benefits to user security such as safer logins and paswordless login.
