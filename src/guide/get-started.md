# Get Started

Passwordless.dev is a software toolkit that helps web developers to support [FIDO2 WebAuthn passkeys](concepts) for authentication by their end-users. In this guide, we'll chart the quickest path to implementing passwordless.dev for your website.

::: tip
This guide will skip over some conceptual basics in order to get you started as quickly as possible. Check out [Concepts](concepts) for in-depth discussion of the ideas used by passwordless.dev.
:::

In this guide we'll provide JavaScript examples, however you can check out sample code, guidelines, and tips for other toolkits in [Backend Languages](backend) and [Frontend Frameworks](frontend).

## Sign up

Sign up for a passwordless.dev account [here](https://adminconsole-devtest.azurewebsites.net/Account/Login). Bitwarden offers a free passwordless.dev account, or paid plans that [unlock certain tiers of usage and features](plans).

When you sign up you'll land on the [Admin Console](admin-console), your primary GUI for creating and configuring applications, monitoring application usage, and managing billing:

<img :src="$withBase('/admin-console.png')" alt="Admin Console">

## Create an application

Select the **Create Application** button and give your new application an **Application name** and **Description**. For each application, a set of [API keys](concepts.html#components-of-the-passwordless-dev-api) will be generated. You'll use these API keys for authentication with the passwordless.dev API. Save your public key and private secret somewhere safe, like [Bitwarden Secrets Manager](https://bitwarden.com/help/secrets-manager-overview).

:::warning
It's important to download your API keys to a safe place, as they will be removed from the admin console after 7 days.

## Install the library

Next, install the [passwordless.dev JavaScript client library](js-client), either globally or as a module within your application. This library will allow your application to interact with the passwordless.dev API and with browsers' WebAuthn API. To install the library:


<CodeSwitcher :languages="{bash1:'yarn',bash2:'npm',es6:'ES6',http:'http'}">
<template v-slot:bash1>

```bash
yarn add @passwordlessdev/passwordless-client
```
In all cases, your frontend must import the library to call the methods used by passwordless.dev:
```js
import { Client } from '@passwordlessdev/passwordless-client';
```
</template>
<template v-slot:bash2>

```bash
npm install @passwordlessdev/passwordless-client
```
In all cases, your frontend must import the library to call the methods used by passwordless.dev:
```js
import { Client } from '@passwordlessdev/passwordless-client';
```
</template>
<template v-slot:es6>

```http
<script src="https://cdn.passwordless.dev/dist/0.3.0/passwordless.min.mjs" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
In all cases, your frontend must import the library to call the methods used by passwordless.dev:
```js
import { Client } from "https://cdn.passwordless.dev/dist/0.3.0/passwordless.min.mjs"
```
</template>
<template v-slot:http>

```http
<script src="https://cdn.passwordless.dev/dist/0.4.0/passwordless.iife.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
In all cases, your frontend must import the library to call the methods used by passwordless.dev:
```http
<script>
var p = new Passwordless.Client({});
</script>
```

</template>
</CodeSwitcher>

## Build a registration flow

Next, implement a workflow on your backend and frontend for registering a [passkey](concepts.html#credentials). Code that you write to do this must:

<Badge text="backend" type="warning"/>
1. Generate a [registration token](concepts.html#tokens) by calling the passwordless.dev API's `/register/token` endpoint ([learn more](api/#register-token)) with, at a minimum, a `userId`, `username`, and `displayname` for the user, for example:

```js
const apiUrl = "https://v3.passwordless.dev";

const payload = {
  "userId": "107fb578-9559-4540-a0e2-f82ad78852f7", // A WebAuthn User Handle, which should be generated by your application. Max. 64 bytes.
  "displayname": "Phillip J. Fry", // A human-palatable name for the account, which should be chosen by the user.
  "username": "pjfry@passwordless.dev", // A username used for user authentication, should be chosen by the user.
  "attType": "None", // WebAuthn attestation conveyance. Can be "none" (default), "direct", or "indirect".
  "authType": "platform", // WebAuthn authenticator attachment modality. Can be "platform" (default), which triggers client device-specific options Windows Hello, FaceID, or TouchID, or "cross-platform", which triggers roaming options like security keys.
  "userVerification": "preferred", // Whether the relying party requires locally-invoked authorization for the operation. Can be "preferred" (default), "required", or "optional".
  "expiresAt": "3023-08-01T14:43:03Z" // Timestamp (UTC) when the registration token should expire. By default, current time + 120 seconds.
};

// POST the payload to the passwordless.dev API using your API private secret.
var token = await fetch(apiUrl + "/register", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
    headers: { "ApiSecret": "myapplication:secret:11f8dd7733744f2596f2a28544b5fbc4", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
});
```

Successful implementation will create a registration token returned that is returned as a string, for example:

```json
"wWdDh02ItIvnCKT_02ItIvn..."
```

<Badge text="frontend" type="tip"/>
2. Initiate, client-side, the WebAuthn process to create and store a WebAuthn credential using the generated registration token ([learn more](js-client)), for example:

```js
const apiUrl = "https://v3.passwordless.dev";

// Instantiate a passwordless client using your API public key.
var p = new Passwordless.Client({
    apiKey: "myapplication:public:4364b1a49a404b38b843fe3697b803c8"
});

// Fetch the returned registration token from the backend.
var myToken = await fetch(apiUrl + "/create-token?userId" + userId).then(r => r.text());

// Register the token with the end-user's device.
try {
    await p.register(myToken);
} catch (e) {
}
```

Successful implementation will prompt passwordless.dev to negotiate creation of a WebAuthn credential through the user's web browser API and save its public key to the database for future sign-in operations.

## Build a signin flow

Next, implement a workflow on your backend and frontend for signing in with a [passkey](concepts.html#credentials). Code that you write must:

<Badge text="frontend" type="tip"/>
1. Generate, client-side, a [verification token](concepts.html#tokens) that will be checked by your backend to complete a sign-in. Include the user's `userId` or alias ([learn more](js-client.html#signin)), for example:

```js
const apiUrl = "https://v3.passwordless.dev";

// Instantiate a passwordless client using your API public key.
var p = new Passwordless.Client({
    apiKey: "myapplication:public:4364b1a49a404b38b843fe3697b803c8"
});

// Allow the user to specify a username or alias.
var alias = "pjfry@passwordless.dev";

// Generate a verification token for the user.
var token = await p.signinWithAlias(alias);

// Call your backend to verify the generated token.
var verifiedUser = await fetch(apiUrl + "/signin?token=" + token).then(r => r.json());
if(verifiedUser.success === true) {
  // If successful, proceed!
}
```

Successful implementation will make a verification token available to the backend. In the above example, the client waits for the backend to return `true` (**step 2**) before proceeding to act on the confirmed sign-in

<Badge text="backend" type="warning"/>
2. Validate the verification token by calling the passwordless.dev API's `/signin/verify` endpoint ([learn more](api/#signin-verify)) with generated token, for example:

```js
const apiUrl = "https://v3.passwordless.dev";

// Fetch the verification token from your frontend.
const token = { token: req.query.token };

// POST the verification token to the passwordless.dev API using your API private secret.
const response = await fetch(apiurl + "/signin/verify", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify(token),
    headers: { "ApiSecret": "myapplication:secret:11f8dd7733744f2596f2a28544b5fbc4", "Content-Type": "application/json" }
});

// Cache the API response (see below) to a variable.
var body = await response.json();

// Check the API response for successful verification.
if (body.success) {
    console.log("Successfully verified sign-in for user.", body);
} else {
    console.warn("Sign in failed.", body);
}
```

Successful implementation of the above `POST` will return a success response including the user's `userId`, for example:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "userId": "123",
  "timestamp": "2021-08-01T01:33:36.9773187Z",
  "rpid": "example.com",
  "origin": "http://example.com:3000",
  "device": "Chrome, Windows 10",
  "country": "",
  "nickname": "Home laptop",
  "credentialId": "Mq1ZhrHBmhly34YaO/uuXuNuf/VCHDkuknENz/LZJR4=",
  "expiresAt": "2021-08-01T01:35:36.9773193Z"
}
```

Use the `.success` value (`true` or `false`) to determine next actions, i.e. whether to complete the sign-in (**step 1**).
